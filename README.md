# MatMice Inspired Project

# Goals
- NSFW detection
- Secure storage of HTML,CSS,JS (No injection attacks please!)
- Save/Load from local storage
- Kid friendly tools for developing the page(s)
- Secret key registration (Must have secret key to register accounts/pages and key changes daily for newly created users)
- Database for perm storage of page(s)
- Max file size per page ( 2MB to start? )
- Javascript support (This will be hard, implemented after full HTML5/CSS3 support is working and secure)
- UI tools for drag and drop development
- AI tools for image generations and code snippets
- Auto Ad detection and removal in linting proccess (And in the case that kids need/want to host ads we perhaps setup a non targeted ad campaign that shows safe advertisments to users accepting viewing IE its off by default and only used as opt-in)
- Video and Image linting for NSFW
- Detect NSFW text/content on page before upload
- Smart contract to host the entire service with direct donation tool to fund the project
- AI Audio Generation. Will be limited to 200 characters per user per month inorder to ensure 50 users may test out the product. Once funds are setup we will increase this limit as high as possible!
- Make a Comic
- Make a Book/Story 
- Make a Poem
- Make a video/slide show

Alot of what I want done is a TODO list that will never end, so use this as a memory bank for ideas to implement but not in any particular order unless otherwise specified.

Given in about a year or two one may hand off the Readme to an AI to complete we are in the clear for all features go! :)
