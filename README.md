# MatMice Inspired Project

# Goals
- NSFW detection
- Secure storage of HTML,CSS,JS (No injection attacks please!)
- Save/Load from local storage
- Kid friendly tools for developing the page(s)
- Secret key registration (Must have secret key to register accounts/pages and key changes daily for newly created users)
- Database for perm storage of page(s)
- Max file size per page ( 2MB to start? )
- Javascript support (This will be hard, implemented after full HTML5/CSS3 support is working and secure)
- UI tools for drag and drop development
- AI tools for image generations and code snippets
- Auto Ad detection and removal in linting proccess (And in the case that kids need/want to host ads we perhaps setup a non targeted ad campaign that shows safe advertisments to users accepting viewing IE its off by default and only used as opt-in)
- Video and Image linting for NSFW
- Detect NSFW text/content on page before upload
- Smart contract to host the entire service with direct donation tool to fund the project
